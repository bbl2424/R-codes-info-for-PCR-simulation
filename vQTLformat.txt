The R package vQTL entails data to be of class cross, requiring the dataset from a csv file to be in a specific format.

The Family.csv file is the dataset for which plants with the same genotypes were planted next to each other in families. The Random.csv file is the dataset for which plants were planted in a random order. 

Both files are formatted as follows:
The first row contains the phenotype names followed by the marker names.
The next row contains blank cells under the phenotype columns, followed by chromosome identifiers.
The third (optional) row contains blank cells under the phenotype columns, followed by marker positions in centimorgans (cMs).
